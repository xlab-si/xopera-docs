## Purpose and description
This was initially the documentation for [xOpera TOSCA orchestration tool] and has been later extended to document all 
the related xOpera tools and services.

## Local building and testing
For documenting xOpera orchestrator we use [Sphinx documentation tool].
Here we can render Sphinx Documentation from RST files and we use [Read the Docs] theme.

To test the documentation locally run the commands below:

```console
# create and activate a new virualenv
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate

# update pip and install Sphinx requirements
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# build the HTML documentation
sphinx-build -M html docs build

# build the Latex and PDF documentation
sphinx-build -M latexpdf docs build
```

After that you will found rendered documentation HTML files in `build` folder and you can open and view them inside 
your browser.
